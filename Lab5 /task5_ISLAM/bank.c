/*
In Step 1: you need to run the program and analyze the execution traces, whereupon you have to identify 
	the synchronization errors. After identifying the synchronization errors,
	you need to insert the "P(sem)" and "V(sem)" operations at right places 
	in the code that fix the synchronization errors.

In Step 2, you work on a measurement component. A mutex algorithm is associated with a "bounded wait" property,
	 i.e., how long a process P is forced to wait for entry into a CS after P has expressed interest in the CS. 
	 Lets call the wait time as T(P), where T(P) is the number of times processes other than P enter the CS after P expresses 
	 interest in the CS but before P actually enters the CS. You need to compute T(P) for all three processes in the problem 
	 and display it at the end of "N" different attempts. Measure T(P) for at least 5 different N’s and include the values in your report.
